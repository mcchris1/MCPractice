### Partition
 Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes
 less than x only need to be right after the elements less than x (see
 below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition";
 it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

 #### EXAMPLE
 Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
 Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

 #### Hints

     <summary>Hint 1</summary>
         There are many solutions to this problem, most of which are equally optimal in
         runtime. Some have shorter, cleaner code than others. Can you brainstorm
         different solutions?

     <summary>Hint 2</summary>
         Consider that the elements don't have to stay in the same relative order. We
         only need to ensure that elements less than the pivot must be before elements
         greater than the pivot. Does that help you come up with more solutions?
