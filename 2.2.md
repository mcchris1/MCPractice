### Return Kth to Last

 Implement an algorithm to find the Kth to last element of a singly linked list.

      What if you knew the linked list size? What is the difference between
     finding the Kth-to-last element and finding the Xth element?

     If you don't know the linked list size, can you compute it? How does this impact
 the runtime?

     Try implementing it recursively. If you could find the (K - 1)th to the last
     element, can you find the Kth element?

     You might find it useful to return multiple values. Some languages don't
     directly support this, but there are workarounds in essentially any
     language. What are some of those workarounds?

     Can you do it iteratively? Imagine if you had two pointers pointing to adjacent
     nodes and they were moving at the same speed through the linked list. When
     one hits the end of the linked list, where will the other be?
