### Palindrome Permutation:

 Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a
 palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and
 backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not
 need to be limited to just dictionary words (you can ignore spaces).

 #### EXAMPLE

 Input:  Tact Coa

 Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc)

     You do not have to -- and should not -- generate all permutations. This
     would be very inefficient.

 Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to O(N) time.

 Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector? (look it up!)
